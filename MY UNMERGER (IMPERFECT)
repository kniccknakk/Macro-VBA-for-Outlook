#note: This one is mine!! (though I realise it's not perfect, but outlook is difficult and this is the best solution i was able to come up with

Public Sub UnmergeConversations()
    Dim Sel As Outlook.Selection
    Dim obj As Object
    Dim i As Long
    Dim NewSubject As String
    
    ' Get the selected items in the Outlook Explorer
    Set Sel = Application.ActiveExplorer.Selection
    
    ' Prompt user for the new subject for the forwarded items
    NewSubject = InputBox("Enter the new subject for the forwarded items:", "New Subject", Sel(1).Subject)
    
    ' Iterate through each selected item and forward it to inbox
    For i = 1 To Sel.Count
        Set obj = Sel(i)
        ForwardToInbox obj, NewSubject
    Next i
End Sub

Private Sub ForwardToInbox(Item As Object, NewSubject As String)
    Dim ForwardedItem As Outlook.MailItem
    
    ' Create a new mail item
    Set ForwardedItem = Application.CreateItem(olMailItem)
    
    ' Set properties for the forwarded item
    ForwardedItem.Subject = NewSubject
    ForwardedItem.Body = Item.Body
    
    ' Save the forwarded item to the inbox
    ForwardedItem.Save
    ForwardedItem.Move Application.GetNamespace("MAPI").GetDefaultFolder(olFolderInbox)
    
    ' Delete the selected item from the old chain
    Item.Delete
    
    ' Clean up
    Set ForwardedItem = Nothing
End Sub
